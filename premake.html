                <h2>In a Nutshell</h2>
                <p>In April 2022 I created my first own portfolio. It looked pretty ok for that time, but as time went on, I noticed some problems. That’s why I started a remake of my portfolio at the end of October.</p>

                <h2>Analysis & Research</h2>
                <p>First, I formulated all my used text in German and English. Then I looked up a lot of portfolios and videos about them and wrote down what appealed to me. In addition to that, the problems of my current website:</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>The homepage appears empty and has no real purpose</li>
                    <li>Boring design</li>
                    <li>Unclear what elements are clickable</li>
                    <li>Project preview hover lacks information or where it will lead too</li>
                    <li>Some projects are outdated</li>
                    <li>Bad layout on the project pages</li>
                    <li>Missing feedback after you click the email button</li>
                    <li>Resume with too personal information is accessible for every page visitor</li>
                    <li>Ugly portraits</li>
                    <li>Everything is in English even though I only searched for jobs in Germany</li>
                    <li>Bad/faulty optimization for mobile</li>

                <h2>Design Sketches</h2>
                <p>The first sketches of the portfolio focussed on 2 navigation pages, a cooler design and optimization for mobile.</p>

                <h2>Prototyping & Design</h2>
                <p>The design process and prototyping happened in Figma. With my new workflow that I learned through my student job, I created a mobile and desktop design of my portfolio.
                    In addition to that, I also made some mockups and previews on Figma.
                    I had to keep in mind what elements would look like on mobile and desktop and if they make sense on them. That’s why I left out the prototype button on the mobile view of project pages.</p>

                <h2>Coding</h2>
                <p>The longest and hardest phase was programming. With a little help through tutorials and forum posts, I managed to create this portfolio on my own. The basic structure is based on a predefined responsive grid with content block in between. Several times errors occurred that I solved through endless trials and research which unleashed real moments of happiness.
                    That’s how I solved the problems:</p>

                <h2>Solutions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Transferred the homepage to the about me page</li>
                    <li>Design: dark mode, new fonts for texts and striking headlines, new project previews</li>
                    <li>Clickable elements are rounded, navigation buttons are even more rounded</li>
                    <li>Next to a short description, the year and the way of redirection is listed through a icon in the project preview hover</li>
                    <li>Removed outdated projects</li>
                    <li>New layout with thumbnails and prototype buttons on the project pages</li>
                    <li>Popup with a notification after clicking the email button</li>
                    <li>Removed the resume</li>
                    <li>New cool portraits</li>
                    <li>You can switch between English and German language</li>
                    <li>Mobile optimized with small adjustments because the mobile view can’t provide all desktop features</li>
