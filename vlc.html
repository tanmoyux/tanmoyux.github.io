                <h2>In a Nutshell</h2>
                <p>During my time at ViveLaCar, I worked as a UI/UX designer in the company’s IT department. 
                    ViveLaCar is a car subscription service.
                    Over the course of these nine months, I gained valuable insights into corporate work structures and processes. My responsibilities were entirely focused on internal design projects, ranging from developing B2B portals to redesigning B2C apps. Eventhough I had to follow a general corporate design, I modernized and improved the given concepts.
                    Here is a selection of my favorite projects:</p>

                <h2>In a Nutshell</h2>
                <p>Development of a new, optimized dealer portal for ViveLaCar to replace the existing Salesforce Experience Cloud solution. This platform serves as a central hub for partnered car dealerships to efficiently manage their vehicles and subscription offerings.
                    The new portal preserves the core functionalities of the current system while delivering significant improvements in usability, design, and overall performance. The redesign consists of around 56 screens for both desktop and mobile.</p>

                <h2>Retrospective</h2>
                <p>During my time at ViveLaCar, I experienced the daily life of a designer within a company, which stands in stark contrast to agency work. Managing tasks through Jira tickets required me to take greater responsibility and improve my self-organization skills.
                    Being part of the IT department also provided valuable insights into the technical aspects that drive a company’s operations. I’m grateful for the opportunity to gain experience in both agency and corporate environments, broadening my perspective as a designer.</p>
