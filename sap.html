                <h2>In a Nutshell</h2>
                <p>SAP is a multinational software corporation and one of Germany’s most successful companies. As a UX Designer at SAP, my primary responsibility was managing a component library and designing new components as needed. I was part of the SIX Design & Piloting team, which focuses on creating high-impact showcases for the SAP Experience Centers and major events such as Sapphire. SAP Experience Centers are physical and virtual collaboration spaces where SAP, customers, and partners co-innovate, prototype, and evaluate SAP solutions through hands-on workshops and demos. My role ranged from maintaining and expanding the component library to designing assets for the S.Market (SAP’s own supermarket) and supporting the Experience Centers in Berlin.

                <h2>In a Nutshell</h2>
                <p>The SIXPAC Lib is the Figma component library used for showcases presented in the Experience Centers. It began with extensive research and the collection of variations of components previously in use. From there, I combined all required features into scalable, unified components that follow SAP Brand design guidelines. I continued to build and maintain the library, clearly documenting the use cases of each component through guidelines and best-practice documentation to ensure a smooth handoff. Today, the library contains over 40 fully customizable components and their respective variants, created collaboratively by my team and me.</p>

                <p>SAP Sapphire 2025 is the flagship global event hosted by SAP, focused on showcasing the latest innovations and strategic vision for enterprise technology. It brings together business leaders, tech experts, and SAP customers to explore how to turn visions into reality through cutting-edge solutions. I ensured a smoother design process for the team by creating universally usable components with extensive functionality for the showcases. The showcases specifically use charts and graphics to visualize how SAP products improve the client performance. Additionally, I helped out with other designs for the experience.</p>

                <h2>In a Nutshell</h2>
                <p>The SAP Experience Agent is a conversational AI chatbot that provides contextual, personalized assistance within SAP applications and channels, using natural language and backend integrations to answer questions, guide users, and execute business tasks. I supported the team by designing ways to display dynamic content responses, the implementation of new chat functions and commands and also redesigning functions for the Experience Agent Landscape feature.</p>

                <h2>Retrospective</h2>
                <p>During my time at SAP, I significantly enhanced my ability to design complex components with advanced functionality. I was responsible for preparing detailed UX specifications for both the design team and developers, ensuring smooth and efficient implementation. Collaborating across international and multidisciplinary teams, as well as proactively reaching out to other departments to drive new initiatives, strengthened my communication and coordination skills. Overall, this experience deepened my understanding of corporate workflows and contributed greatly to my growth as a UX designer in a global context.</p>
