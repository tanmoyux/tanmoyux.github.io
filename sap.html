                <h2>In a Nutshell</h2>
                <p>SAP is a multinational software corporation and one of Germany’s most successful companies. As a UX Designer at SAP, my primary responsibility was managing a component library and designing new components as needed. I was part of the SIX Design & Piloting team, which focuses on creating high-impact showcases for the SAP Experience Centers and major events such as Sapphire. My role ranged from maintaining and expanding the component library to illustrating keynote visuals and designing assets for various SAP departments.
