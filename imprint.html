                <p>As a service provider, I am responsible under Section 7 (1) TMG for my own content on these pages in accordance with general laws. However, under Sections 8 to 10 TMG, I am not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

                <p>My website contains links to external third-party websites, over whose content I have no control. Therefore, I cannot accept any responsibility for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for their content. Linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking, and no illegal content was identified at that time. Permanent monitoring of the content of linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. If I become aware of any legal violations, I will promptly remove such links.</p>
