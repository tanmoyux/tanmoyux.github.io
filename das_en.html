                <h2>In a Nutshell</h2>
                <p>DAS (Detect weak points, Analyze risks, Secure the system) is a threat managing software application developed for the cybersecurity firm MailbornWolff by "Das Hexagon", a team comprised of six computer science students and one communication design student (me) from Hochschule Mannheim, as part of the SEP (software engineering project).</p>
            </section>
            <section id="sect2">
                <h2>Task</h2>
                <p>The request to us was a web program that let you easily visualize a customer's IT system architecture with icons that should be able to be connected and edited with different parameters and values. Several other must-have and can-have features were listed.
                    Due to this specific case, the usual research phase of UX design has been altered.</p>
            </section>
            <h1 id="hl2">Process</h1>
            <section id="sect3">
                <h2>Analysis & Research</h2>
                <p>First, we had to understand the whole risk analysis process. This happened after lectures by MailbornWolff and summaries and analyses of the learned.
                    Then I specifically planned out the UX and regular design through analyses of competing programs already on the market. I studied their design, UX and noted down pros and cons of the respective program.
                    I even looked at Super Mario Maker because the firm proposed a drag and drop bar for the icons.</p>

                <h2>Unique Selling Point</h2>
                <p>Our unique selling point is the inclusion of the "4x6-Methode", a method specifically developed by the company that consists of 6 potential points of attacks and 4 types of attackers.</p>

            <section id="sect5">
                <h2>User Story Map</h2>
                <p>After all the lectures by MailbornWolff we defined a user story map that covers all necessary functions and features of the needed program. Due to the growing complexity, this took several tries to finally nail and truthfully understand.</p>

                <h2>Design Sketches</h2>
                <p>The first sketches of the surface and interface used drag and drop bars to place the icons on the canvas. This was later removed in favor of a radial menu.</p>

            <section id="sect7">
                <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                <p>The design process started out with prototyping in Figma. The overall design is kept in a simple, minimalistic but still easy to understand way that also follows MailbornWolff’s corporate design.
                    All interactive elements are rounded and/or grayish to distinguish themselves from the black and sharp non-interactive elements.
                    The growing complexity of the whole program with the steady feedback through tests led to ever-changing pages throughout the whole designing phase.</p>

                <h2>Retrospective</h2>
                <p>The biggest thing I’ve learned through this experience was how it would be to work with computer scientists as a single designer. Truly a humbling and educational experience. Other useful things were bringing my Figma skills to a whole new level, finding out about useful websites like getbootstrap.com and of course working with a big client.</p>
